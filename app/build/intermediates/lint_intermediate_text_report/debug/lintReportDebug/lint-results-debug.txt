/Users/Matt/Development/lab/foo/hello-android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:3: Warning: Should explicitly set android:icon, there is no default [MissingApplicationIcon]
  <application>
   ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingApplicationIcon":
   You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no
   default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource
   containing the image (for example @drawable/icon).

/Users/Matt/Development/lab/foo/hello-android/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml:6: Warning: Hardcoded string "Hello Android!", should use @string resource [HardcodedText]
  android:text="Hello Android!"
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "HardcodedText":
   Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several
   reasons:

   * When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or
   portrait) you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when
   making changes)

   * The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding
   new translations for existing string resources.

   There are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a
   resource lookup.
